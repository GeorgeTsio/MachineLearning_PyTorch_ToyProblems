### **Machine Learning - Toy Problems**

In this section I will go through some toy, but foundamental problems in Machine Learning. My first code: `ComputerVision_CNN` is a Computer Vision problem, where I'm 
trying to create a Convolutionary Neural Network (CNN), in order to make predictions about the famous dataset MNIST. Also, in `Binary_classification` there is a machine learning approach for a binary classification problem.
